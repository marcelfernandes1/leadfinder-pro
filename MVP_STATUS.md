   - **Fix:** Kill old instances if needed
   - **Command:** `pkill -f "next dev"` then restart

2. **Social media discovery not implemented**
   - **Impact:** Instagram/Facebook fields will be null
   - **Status:** Intentionally skipped for MVP (Apify cost concerns)
   - **Note:** Can be added post-launch if needed
